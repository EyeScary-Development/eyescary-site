            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>
                Variables are created in a very simple way. You write "var
                (variablename) (variablevalue)" As of ESDLang 4, variables are
                dynamically typed and so don't need their types declaring
            </p>
            <esd>var coolvariable (value)</esd>
            <p>
                Variables can have numbers subtracted or added to them, provided
                they are formatted as a number when initially made, it looks
                like this
            </p>
            <esd
                >var supercoolnumber 12<br />
                write the current value of the number is supercoolnumber <br />
                var supercoolnumber -5<br />write oh no! the value of the number
                has dropped to supercoolnumber</esd
            >
            <p>
                Do note however, you cannot change the size of a variable by a
                radnom or an input
            </p>
            <h2>Writing and Input</h2>
            <p>
                Writing is done by typing 'write' and then any other text on
                that line is treated as what to output. Variables are
                automatically converted to their values. For example:
            </p>
            <esd>write The value of the variable is coolvariable.</esd>
            <p>
                Input is done a similar way. You write 'input ' and then
                everything afterwards is treated as what to write. The data will
                be saved to a var initalised previously.
            </p>
            <esd
                >var yourname input Hello, enter your name: <br />write Welcome
                to this program, yourname</esd
            >
            <h2>If/Else statements</h2>
            <p>
                If/else statements are defined by writing if and then a value,
                then a condition (=,>=,<=,>,<,x(not equal to)) and then another
                value, with spaces in between of course. You write your
                if-statement affected code below the if statement. Then when
                you're ready, write else on a new line and write your code for
                if those conditions aren't true, close up the statement with
                endstat. if you just want an if statement, just leave the else
                line empty (you still need endstat).
            </p>
            <esd
                >if coolvariable = test<br />write The variable is equal to
                test!<br />else<br />write The variable is not equal to test!<br />endstat</esd
            >
            <h2>Random Numbers</h2>
            <p>
                Random numbers are created using radnom and with the newest
                update to ESDlang, you can now make them as big as you want
                instead of the max being 9, here's how to make a variable that
                is a random number
            </p>
            <esd
                >var supercoolnumber radnom 23 67<br />write your age is
                supercoolnumber</esd
            >
