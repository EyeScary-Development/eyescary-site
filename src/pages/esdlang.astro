        <h1>ESDLang</h1>
        <p>
            a simple programming language with a minimal syntax,
            currently in version 7
        </p>
        <p>
            NEWS!: ESDLang 7 is here! It's now got functions! to create one, simply write <code
                class="inlinecode">function namehere</code>, write your code below and then close the function with
            <code class="inlinecode">endfunction namehere</code>
        </p>
        <h2>What would coding with it look like?</h2>
        <p>
            ESDLang is a programming language like very few, no
            brackets, quotes or tags are needed here! the first word you
            type is always a reserved word, anything after that is just
            requirements for a function which can be <i>anything</i>.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Here's how some basic code might look:</p>
        <p>
            <code>
                    write hello<br>
                    var name input what is your name?: <br>
                    write hello, name , have a good day!<br><br>
                    This code produces: <br>
                    hello<br>
                    what is your name?: (name) <br>
                    hello, (name) , have a good day!
                </code>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Features currently not working: <br><br>
            Punctuation has to be separate from a variable for a
            variable to register<br>
            Converting a variable from a number to a string and back to
            a number may cause the dynamic typing system to fail to
            return the variable to a number<br>
            Must write <code class="inlinecode">quit</code> at the end of your program to
            close the program (one small problem that comes with the
            optimisations)<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Can I download it?</h2>
        <p>Sure, download it here:</p>
        <a href="/dl/ESDLang.zip"><button class="buttonlt">Download ESDLang</button></a>
        <p>
            when you extract the zip, edit the file named trun.txt, this
            is where you write your code
        </p>
