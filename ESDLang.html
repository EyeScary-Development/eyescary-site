                <h1>ESDLang</h1>
                <p>
                    a simple programming language with a minimal syntax,
                    currently in version 6
                </p>
                <p>
          NEWS!: ESDLang 6 is here! and it's <i>TURING COMPLETE</i>! we added while loops, defined the same way as if statements (but with while instead of if), however we have implemented a seperate <code>endwhile</code> statement so that our interpreter isn't confused when you have an if statement in a while statement

                <h2>What would coding with it look like?</h2>
                <p>
                    codeLang is a programming language like very few, no
                    brackets, quotes or tags are needed here! the first word you
                    type is always a reserved word, anything after that is just
                    requirements for a function which can be <i>anything</i>.
                </p>
                <br /><br />
                <p>Here's how some basic code might look:</p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        write hello<br />
                        var name input what is your name?: <br>
                        write hello, name , have a good day!<br /><br />
                        This code produces: <br />
                        hello<br />
                        what is your name?: (name) <br />
                        hello, (name) , have a good day!
                    </code>
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Features currently not working: <br /><br />
                    Punctuation has to be separate from a variable for a
                    variable to register<br />
                    Converting a variable from a number to a string and back to
                    a number may cause the dynamic typing system to fail to
                    return the variable to a number<br />
                    Must write <code>quit</code> at the end of your program to
                    close the program (one small problem that comes with the
                    optimisations)<br />
                </p>
                <h2>Can I download it?</h2>
                <p>Sure, download it here:</p>
                <a href="dl?fileName=codeLang.zip"
                    ><button class="buttonlt">Download ESDLang 6</button></a
                >
                <p>
                    when you extract the zip, edit the file named trun.txt, this
                    is where you write your code
                </p>
