            <h2>What would coding with it look like?</h2>
            <p>
                ESDLang is a programming language like very few, no
                brackets, quotes or tags are needed here! the first word you
                type is always a reserved word, anything after that is just
                requirements for a function which can be <i>anything</i>.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Here's how some basic code might look:</p>
            <p>
                <code>
                    write hello<br>
                    var name input what is your name?: <br>
                    write hello, name , have a good day!<br><br>
                    This code produces: <br>
                    hello<br>
                    what is your name?: (name) <br>
                    hello, (name) , have a good day!
                </code>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Features currently not working: <br><br>
                Punctuation has to be separate from a variable for a
                variable to register<br>
                Converting a variable from a number to a string and back to
                a number may cause the dynamic typing system to fail to
                return the variable to a number<br>
                Must write <code class="inlinecode">quit</code> at the end of your program to
                close the program (one small problem that comes with the
                optimisations)<br>
            </p>
            <h2>Can I download it?</h2>
            <p>Sure, download it here:</p>
            <a href="dl?fileName=ESDLang.zip"><button class="buttonlt">Download ESDLang 6</button></a>
            <p>
                when you extract the zip, edit the file named trun.txt, this
                is where you write your code
            </p>
