                <b>
                    this is an older, fully stable version of stronge, features
                    like changing previous lines are not in this version, this
                    also uses an older version of esdlang. But these features
                    can be found in stronge 0.3 and later
                </b>
            </p>
            <p>
                when you launch stronge, it will prompt you to come up with a
                filename, then a file extension, put your chosen file extension
                here or leave the input blank for .txt, then get to writing
                code! to clear a file, type <code>filclr</code> on a new line,
                to save a file and exit, type <code>savex</code> on a new line,
                and to run your ESDLang code, type <code>savrun</code> on a new
                line
            </p>
            <br>
