            <p>CSCode is a code editor based around the <a href="https://ace.c9.io">Ace code editor</a> base. Our main goal with this is to make it easier to configure for the average person. Current features are : <br><br>New!: Test HTML, CSS or JS code! (CSS tester allows you to view the effect of your css on different elements, html tester can also have css and js, and the js tester is mainly good for scripting in the console like python)<br>Modifiable fonts and size<br>Toggleable line wrapping<br>Variable tab size<br>Custom themes (currently available: dracula, gruvbox, default/light theme)</p>
